// abstract class

// abstarct and non astract method
// 0 - 100% abstraction
// abstract class can have constructor
// abstract class always extends with child one




// interfcae

// all methods public and abstract
// public static final variables
// 100% abstraction
// interfcae dont have contsrucor
// interface implements with child one class
// interface to interfcae extends

#java 8 changes
// n number of static and default method
// only one abstract method we can have
// @FunctionalInterfcae anotation we have use(optional)



// difference between abstract class and interface in java

*************************************************************


// In which case should use Interface and another case in Abstract class.(Hint - Calculator example)

// provide answer in points
// 1. Use Interface when you need to define a contract for multiple classes to implement, allowing for multiple inheritance of type.
// Use Abstract Class when you want to provide a common base with shared code and state for related classes, allowing for single inheritance.
// 2. Use Interface when you want to achieve full abstraction and define behavior without implementation.
// Use Abstract Class when you want to provide partial implementation along with abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.
// 3. Use Interface when you need to define capabilities that can be added to any class, regardless of its position in the class hierarchy.
// Use Abstract Class when you want to establish a clear relationship between classes that share common characteristics.
// 4. Use Interface when you want to take advantage of polymorphism and allow different classes to be treated uniformly based on shared behavior.
// Use Abstract Class when you want to enforce a specific structure and provide a common interface for related classes.
// 5. Use Interface when you want to define a contract that can be implemented by classes from different class hierarchies.
// Use Abstract Class when you want to create a base class that provides common functionality and state for a group of related classes.
